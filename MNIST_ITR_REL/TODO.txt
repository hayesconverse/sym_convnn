1. Calculate safe input regions covering the training set for all classes.
2. Ennumerate training inputs for every safe region. Summarize visually or using union of under approximation boxes. 

3. Calculate safe regions at an intermediate layer , do the same analysis.
4. Can compare the summaries and visualization to see which captures the common features better.

5. Check if the misclassified inputs fall inside existing safe regions.

6. Calculate min max solutions for path constraints (till the output layer).
